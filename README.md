# SYS3 Sortainer SYS3 Drawer Gridfinity Baseplates

Remix of [Asotrot's
baseplates](https://makerworld.com/en/models/832744?from=search#profileId-777400)
with dimensional adjustments that allow for inconsistencies in drawer widths.

Also included is a rebuild of the baseplate to feature magnet holders using the
[FreeCAD Gridfinity
Workbench](https://github.com/Stu142/FreeCAD-Gridfinity-Workbench).  The
magnets in this version of the baseplate provide much more stability for small
gridfinity modules when the drawers are opened and closed or when the whole
container is transported.

Both versions of the baseplate should be compatible with Festool Sortainer³
SYS3-SORT/3 M 337, Sortainer³ SYS3-SORT/2 M 337, and the TANOS-branded versions
of the same products.

These models are likely NOT compatible with other Sortainer versions.  Please
check for other models for previous Sortainer versions.
